The neuron 


How can we recreate a neuron into a maching?
Santiago remon drew the first neuron in 1899

Neuron consists of  dendrites , neuron , axon.

Dendrites are the receivers and axon is the transmitter of the neuron.
Signal from the neuron travel down from the axon and into the the dendrite of the other neuron.
Axon and dendrites are not connected physically of two different neurons.

The connection is called synapse.
We use the term synapse in data science and no dendrites or axon.

The activation function.


1. Threshole function.
	if x >= 0 then true
	else if x < 0 then false 

	pretty straightforward

2. Sigmoid function.
	f(x) = 1/ 1+e raised to -x 
	Good thing about this function is it is smooth.

3. Rectifire function 
	f(x) = max(x,0)
	one of the most used functions.

4. Hyperbolic tangent function.
	
	f(x) =( 1 - e^-2x ) / ( 1+ e ^-2x)
	could be used sometimes.
